This program requires the file name 'Data.txt' to do the right work.
Basically, you are reveiving student names and are reorganizing the data within the file.
The program is quite simple that doesn't really require you to revisit in the future.
You can use this program to practice translating it into future programming languages you are 
learning. Other than that, don't bother revisiting unless you want to remind yourself how manipulating
files in c++ works.
