# School Assignments

## Introduction

There has been several school assignments that I have worked on more than what it is shown here. Although, I did not start keeping track of all of them until just recently. Therefore, any new college assignment from now on will be uploaded here into this git repository to show my proficiency in different languages. Within each specific language folder, you will find raw txt files only instead of file extensions such as cpp, java, asm, and so on. Moreover, you will also find files that are actually conversions of one program to another programming language. This will be specified in the **Index** content section below of course.

Concepts of Programming Languages class assignments which involved working in languages such as Racket and Prolog. The goal of each assignment was to expose students to utilize unknown languages outside of the scope of languages we already knew. For example, there was an 8 queens problem that needed to be converted to Prolog by the end of the course.
